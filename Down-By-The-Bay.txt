Down by the bay.
Where the watermelons grow.
Back to my home.
I dare not go,
For if I do.
My mother will say,
"Did you ever see a fish making a wish?"
Down by the bay.

. . . My mother will say,
"Did you ever see a cheetah eating a pita?"
Dwn by the bay.

. . . My mother will say,
"Did you ever see a duck driving a truck?"
Down by the bay.
